The number of lines that can be printed on a piece of paper depends on the
paper size, the point size of each character in a line, whether lines are
double-spaced or single-spaced, the top and bottom margin, and the left
and right margins of the paper. Assume that all characters are of the same
point size, and all lines are either single-spaced or double-spaced. Note that
1 inch = 72 points. Moreover, assume that the lines are printed along the
width of the paper. For example, if the length of the paper is 11 inches and
the width is 8.5 inches, then the maximum length of a line is 8.5 inches.
Write a program that calculates the number of characters in a line and the
number of lines that can be printed on a paper based on the following input
from the user:

a. The length and width, in inches, of the paper.
b. The top, bottom, left, and right margins.
c. The point size of a line.
d. If the lines are double-spaced, then double the point size of each character.
