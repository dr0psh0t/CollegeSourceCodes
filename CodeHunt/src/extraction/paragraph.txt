In computer science, graphs are used to represent networks of communication, data organization,
computational devices, the flow of computation, etc. For instance, the link structure of a
website can be represented by a directed graph, in which the vertices represent web pages and
directed edges represent links from one page to another. A similar approach can be taken to problems
in travel, biology, computer chip design, and many other fields. The development of algorithms to
handle graphs is therefore of major interest in computer science. The transformation of graphs is
often formalized and represented by graph rewrite systems. Complementary to graph transformation
systems focusing on rule-based in-memory manipulation of graphs are graph databases geared towards
transaction-safe, persistent storing and querying of graph-structured data.
